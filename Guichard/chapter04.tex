\chapter{Transcendental Functions}

So far we have used only algebraic functions as examples when finding
derivatives, that is, functions that can be built up by the usual
algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and raising to constant powers. Both in theory and practice
there are other functions, called transcendental\index{transcendental
function}, that are very useful. Most important among these are the
trigonometric functions, the inverse trigonometric functions,
exponential functions, and logarithms.
